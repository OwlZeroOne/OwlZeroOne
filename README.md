<h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
<p>
  I am a computing student situated in Edinburgh, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. I will be studying Software Engineering as of September 2023 in order to complete my degree and kick off into the world of advanced computing. I am very passionate about programming, which essentially makes no difference to me whether I'm programming a piece of software, a website or game logic. Despite the difficulties of testing and debugging my code, the end-result is what empowers me to do more.

  <h3>My Education</h3>

  <h4>2012 - 2018: Baby Steps</h4>
  <p>
    I have attended high school in Edinburgh, where my computing journey has begun towards my final years, where I learned the foundations of software development, web development, databases and computer systems.
  </p>

  <h4>2018 - 2019: Games Development</h4>
  <p>
    I have attended a Games Development course in Edinburgh College, where I was introduced to Object-Oriented Programming and game development and design. We got the opportunity to program a simple game using C# as our first semester project. In the second semester, we learned to create games using Epic Games' Unreal Engine, which applies visual coding using nodes and links.
  </p>
  
  <h4>2019 - 2020: Software Development</h4>
  <p>
    I have transitioned to a Software Development course, still at Edinburgh College, where I did Object-Oriented Programming for the second time using Java. I have also enhanced my knowledge of computer systems. Furthermore, I was introduced to software systems design, low-level language programming using Linux Shell and x86 Assembly, professionalism and ethics, project management and mobile technologies.
  </p>
  
  <h4>2020 - 2022: Computer Science</h4>
  <p>
  I have attended first two years of BSc Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, picking up on certain aspects from college like Object-Oriented Programming in Java, computer systems and low-level language programming using C and MIPS Assembly. Among the new things I learned were: functional programming unsing Haskell, computational logic, algorithms & data structures, data scienece, software engineering and cognative science from computational point of view using Python.
  </p>
  
  <h4>2022 - 2023: Break Time</h4>
  <p>
    I have taken on a gap year to do some shadow work and self-development while employed by th University of Edinburgh Estates Department. In the mean time I have been continuously learning new things, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, more Haskell, graphic design, software design patterns, and more algorithms & data structures.
  </p>
  
  <h4>2023 - 2025: Software Engineering</h4>
  <p>
    I will be returning to full-time education at Edinburgh Napier University specialising in BEng Software Engineering, starting from year 3.
